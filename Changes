    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKING: Prior to this revision, .add-route() allowed the
    * options part of the argument to be specified as a list of pairs rather
    * than always as a hash. This was a mistake. The second argument, regardless
    * of whether it is passed using the two argument multi or as a list of
    * pairs, the options must always be passed as a hash.
